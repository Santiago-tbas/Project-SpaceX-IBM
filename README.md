This compilation of files presents a comparative analysis of a dataset with the objective of predicting the conditions under which a rocket launch is successful. The main goal is to program and validate the most suitable supervised ML model for this scenario. The analysis begins with data collection from multiple sources, including the SpaceX API and web scraping, followed by data cleaning and standardization. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted using various visualization tools, including a Dash app to create an interactive dashboard. Finally, the models are implemented and analyzed, focusing primarily on the Accuracy metric for validation.
